This is a simple shell on NETBSD system.
usage: sish [ −x] [ −c command]

Difficulties:
- I/O redirection
- piplining. Connecting stdout of one command to another command

Test cases other than provided:
- stdout/stdin redirection for multiple combinations: ls -l>file ls >file -l, ls -l >file>file2 etc
- if $$$$ is provided then it should be resolved. $$ and $? should not only be resolved in echo but also for other commands
